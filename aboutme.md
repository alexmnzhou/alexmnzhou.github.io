I'm Alex Zhou, a physics-turned-business analytics student with interests in biophysics, data science, and business intelligence.

In my free time, I enjoy writing ([mostly short stories](http://physicstomato.com/category/writing-playground) or [analytics projects](https://medium.com/@alexzhou_13584)), [jazz composition](http://physicstomato.com/category/intentional-accidentals), rock climbing, and the occasional stint of video making; I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvIi1smo9fSt0HiyQVDuSew), but it&#8217;s mostly to share song covers with friends. I keep a&nbsp;[resume](https://www.physicstomato.com/resume/)&nbsp;online for those who may want to work with me.

### About this Website

This all started because I wanted share some ideas that I found interesting with my friends in a nice format. Over time, I also realized it could serve as an outlet for my creative hobbies, research, and work-related projects. In its current state, physicstomato.com should serve all of those goals fairly equally.

I mostly chose the name Physics Tomato because physicspotato.com<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>which, let&#8217;s be honest, is a lot funnier<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>was taken by a domain reseller. When I made this site, they were selling the domain for _**3000 dollars****!**_ Who the hell would want &#8220;Physics Potato&#8221; as their brand, other than me?

Screw domain resellers.
