I often find that one of the easiest ways to learn is to teach. Apparently, I&#8217;m not the only one; there&#8217;s real science on this. _<a href="http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The protégé effect is real</a>_.

I&#8217;ll be posting my notes on various subjects that I&#8217;m learning to help others and myself. They&#8217;ll be organized by broad topic, each having many subsections that fall under it.

I can&#8217;t guarantee the scholarly accuracy of my notes – they&#8217;re really more for me than anyone else – but I try to stand behind the quality of their writing and organization. I&#8217;ll respond to any questions or comments as best I can, and I&#8217;m glad to change anything pointed out to me as incorrect.
