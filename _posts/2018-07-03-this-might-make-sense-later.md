      Her car was mostly well kept. I took off my earbuds to be polite and stepped in.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      She turned to greet me. Her hair was a deep red. She looked not much older than me, but definitely older.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Hi, how are ya doing tonight?”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Pretty good! You know, I actually just dyed my hair back to black.” I said.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      Her eyes brightened and she smiled. “Ooh, what color was it before?”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “See, I’d been swimming for a while, so it was turning like a weird orange-brown, then I decided to make it black again today.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Like the Amy Winehouse song: Back to blaaaaack.&#8221; she sang.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &#8220;Ha. Yeah.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      &#8220;Mine’s dyed too actually. My natural hair is like a super duper light blonde.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I looked over again guiltily to confirm I hadn’t seen her hair wrong this whole time. “No kidding?”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Yup. In high school I did pink, green, purple, whatever.” She smiled and stopped speaking to focus on backing out of the driveway. “Your color too! I was actually black haired most of senior year.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Oh wow.” I paused for a moment to decide if I should to tell her my other story involving hair dye. “Ya know, I was actually blue haired for a bit — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">on accident</em>.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      She laughed. “On accident?! What do you mean?”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Okay, so a few months ago I wanted to go light brown, but I didn’t bleach it enough so it ended up like, half-baked.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      She gave me an expression that seemed like it couldn’t decide between pity and excitement. “Uh huh.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Then a few weeks later my friend was like ‘Why don’t we try again?’ So we picked up a new bottle of bleach and dye and she suggested we mix it with the leftover dye from before… and then something crazy happened, I guess.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Oh my god!”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Yeah, I don’t know what, like, insane chemistry was going on in my hair then,” I waved my hands wildly around my head for added effect. “…but I guess brown plus slightly darker brown makes blue!”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “That’s wicked! You know in my workplace, they don’t let you have weird hair colors. They’d never let me get away with blue.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “But your hair <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> dyed. It’s red. I mean, what’s the cutoff for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">too</em> risque hair?”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Right?! Who knows. But tattoos, piercings, and jeans are allowed.” She said, raising a finger as she listed each item.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I considered what to say next. The tires started to grind against rougher pavement; we were leaving West Haven. I asked, “Do you have any tattoos?”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Yeah, actually! My entire back is done.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Whoa, really? I thought about it once but I don’t really have anything like, worth tattooing.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Yep. I got five different tattoos from when I was 18 to 23. One for the most important event of each year.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Whoa.” <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">That’s crazy</em>, I thought. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Crazy but awesome</em>. “What would you say was the best one? You know, like the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">best</em> best event?”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      She turned to me and let out a kind of practiced laugh. “Ha, well I’d have to go with 23, my divorce.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Yeah? What does that one look like?”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Well, it’s a bird.” Her mouth formed what resembled a smile, but it was one of those expressions you could tell was stowing emotion between the lines of her face. She continued, “And right next to that bird are the words:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote class="graf graf--pullquote">
      <p>
        This<br /> might<br /> make<br /> sense<br /> later.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I wondered about the significance of those words for a moment.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “That’s clever. I really like that.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Thank you.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Did you have any idea what it could’ve meant back then?”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
      “Nope, and I still don’t.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I chuckled. “Wow.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      Of course I wondered about it. And I wondered some more for the rest of the ride until our conversation became noise.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I didn’t ask to see how it looked, but I wondered what kind of bird it was.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I wondered about all the different possible meanings of her tattoo, of how the bird on her back could represent her future love, maybe a pearly white dove, so the words indicate how her divorce is validated once she finds somebody better for herself.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      Or maybe it was like Maya Angelou’s <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48989/caged-bird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48989/caged-bird">poem about the caged bird</a>, the one that sings of freedom, personifying the breadth of new possibility divorce from a failed marriage could bring.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      Maybe still, it was to demonstrate how life plans are often winding and unpredictable (like, say, the decision to get a permanent tattoo that means nothing yet), so the words serve as a constant, bodily reminder that one day she’ll make sense of it all, or not.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I wondered about why she picked a bird, instead of a butterfly, since a butterfly would better symbolize the consequence of choice. I thought it was possible she was holding out for that tiniest chance, the right miracle where coincidentally, a bird of some form (be it figurative or literal) would eventually come to represent a significant moment in her life.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      And from there, she could assume all the ensuing profundity of getting it tattooed back when she was 23.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      Or maybe, I’d thought, maybe she just felt like birds that day.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      And for some reason, what seemed like the most mundane answer was just as compelling as the wild others I’d dreamt up.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I thought hard about it, about how those five words might fit together so well, about how even the most polar interpretations worked in tandem, not against each another.
    </p>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      I thought about how a meaningless tattoo could seem to make more and more sense the more I thought about it, and then I lost myself in that spiral of thinking.

        “Well, here we are. I hope you have a nice night.”
      </p>
      
      <p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">
        “Yeah, you too. Take care.” I opened the door and stepped out. We exchanged a glance for another moment before we both turned away.
      </p>
      
      <p class="graf graf--p">
        I stood outside her car, awestruck and shaking from the cold Fair Haven air. I thought for a moment that this was all just my late night musings running wild, that there wasn’t any extra meaning to be uncovered with her spur-of-the-moment bird tattoo.
      </p>

        But whatever—I mean, this might make sense later.

          <p class="graf graf--p">
            I mistook my driver for someone who happened to be parked slightly closer. It was awkward to shut the door after that mistake and then walk to my actual driver.

          <p class="graf graf--p">
            I got in his car. We exchanged greetings. We didn’t speak for the rest of the ride. We exchanged goodbyes. I clumsily had to take a few extra seconds getting off my seatbelt and propping open the door — oops, it closed on my leg—propping open the door after I’d already said goodbye.
