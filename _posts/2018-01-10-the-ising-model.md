### Introduction

* * *

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be argued with some vehemence that thermodynamics is just about the most boring field of study in all of physics. With all due respect to a vastly important and verifiably useful field, thermodynamics is not, at a core conceptual level, a particularly </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">interesting</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">subject.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many study physics in search of escape—the great unknowns of astronomy or the mind-boggling, unintuitive nature of quantum mechanics. Thermodynamics, on the other hand, doesn&#8217;t at all carry that same </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">mythicism. </span>_

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the contrary, your first ventures into something like quantum mechanics will yield exceptionally interesting results (as a pedagogical tool, they are often designed to). Even as you complete your first lessons in the field, you come to some truly perplexing and profound conclusions: that things can exist in superposition, our complete theory of the world can never be “realistic” and local (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bell’s theorem</a>), and nature, at the smallest scale, is intrinsically discrete.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first finish a long, intense bout of thermodynamic calculations, you can only hope to come to the striking realization of: “Oh, I suppose the system would then heat up by 10 degrees Kelvin.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thermodynamics will not attempt to entice you to understand it for the sake of understanding it; you will instead need to have the discipline to work through it simply because it is necessary preliminary for what lies ahead. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, the problems I and many others have long had with the field (that you should bring upon yourself to be made aware of before proceeding):</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to most other fields of physics, it’s conceptually dull.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The mathematics are tedious to perform (as one fellow student once put it, thermodynamics is a “zoo of partial derivatives”).</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Thermodynamic systems and calculations describe macroscopic, “real-life” scenarios, unlike the (arguably) more exciting areas of other physics studies.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so finally, only now that we have been made keenly aware of all the troubles one will likely face as a physics student making the initial venture into thermodynamics, we will study exactly what I warned of for its excess of real-world analogs and unrelenting mundanity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But hey, maybe that’s your thing.</span>
